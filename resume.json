The design includes everything from different availability zones, storage pools (both local and stretched between multiple data centers), and involves roughly 50 nodes. The deployment of OpenStack is done through the Red Hat Director, while Ceph is being deployed using the Ceph Ansible Playbook. We have chosen this configuration to get an environment that scales and fulfills our internal customers requirements. \n During the implementation I’ve encountered quite a few bugs in various components (neutron, octavia, heat-templates, networkmanager) which have actively been reported upstream (also monkey patched a few things locally to work around numerous deployment issues).\n On top of that I’ve also built our own internal portal where the users can create, delete and manage access to their projects. Authentication to the portal, and to the cloud, is done via Kerberos (Active Directory) and supports Single Sign On. "
